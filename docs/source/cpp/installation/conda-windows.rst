conda for Windows
=================

.. note::

   We recommend creating a new virtual environment to install ``sherpa``.

.. hint::

   At present, we only provide CPU version of pre-built conda packages for
   Windows. If you want to use a CUDA version of ``sherpa``, please consider
   installing ``sherpa`` from source.

The command to install ``sherpa`` for Windows using ``conda`` is:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install \
     -c k2-fsa \
     -c k2-fsa-sherpa \
     -c kaldifeat \
     -c pytorch \
     k2 \
     sherpa \
     kaldifeat \
     pytorch=1.12.0 \
     python=3.8

or the following command in one line:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c k2-fsa -c k2-fsa-sherpa -c kaldifeat -c pytorch k2 sherpa kaldifeat pytorch=1.12.0 python=3.8

.. caution::

   It is of paramount importance that you specify the ``-c`` options while
   installing ``sherpa``. Otherwise, you will be SAD.

   You can switch the orders of different options for ``-c``, but you cannot
   omit them.

We provide pre-built conda packages for ``Python >= 3.7`` and ``PyTorch >= 1.6.0``.
Please consider installing ``sherpa`` from source if you have other requirements.


You can use:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda search -c k2-fsa-sherpa sherpa

to check all available ``sherpa`` packages for different combinations of
``Python`` and ``PyTorch``. A sample output of the above command is listed below:

.. code-block:: bash

  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.11.0  k2-fsa-sherpa
  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.12.0  k2-fsa-sherpa
  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.12.1  k2-fsa-sherpa
  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.8.0  k2-fsa-sherpa
  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.8.1  k2-fsa-sherpa
  sherpa                           0.6 cpu_py3.7_torch1.9.0  k2-fsa-sherpa

Settings after installation
---------------------------

Suppose that you have created an environment named ``sherpa`` for installation
using the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n sherpa
   conda activate sherpa

To check whether you have installed ``sherpa`` successfully or not, please run
the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

  (sherpa) fangjun@M-0LQSDCC2RV398 C:\Users\fangjun>sherpa
  'sherpa' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
  operable program or batch file.

It reports that Windows cannot find the executable ``sherpa.exe``. We have
to set the following environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

  (sherpa) fangjun@M-0LQSDCC2RV398 C:\Users\fangjun>set path=%conda_prefix%\lib\site-packages\sherpa\bin;%path%

After setting the ``path`` environment variable, we can run ``sherpa`` again:

.. code-block:: bash

  (sherpa) fangjun@M-0LQSDCC2RV398 C:\Users\fangjun>sherpa

  (sherpa) fangjun@M-0LQSDCC2RV398 C:\Users\fangjun>sherpa --help

  (sherpa) fangjun@M-0LQSDCC2RV398 C:\Users\fangjun>

It does not complain about being not able to find ``sherpa.exe``. However, it
prints nothing.

The reason is that ``sherpa.exe`` cannot find ``torch_cpu.dll``. You have to
add another directory to the environment variable ``path`` using:

.. code-block:: bash

   set path=%conda_prefix%\lib\site-packages\torch\lib;%path%

Now you can run ``sherpa`` in the commandline:

.. code-block:: bash

   sherpa --help

You will get something like the following screenshot:

Congratulations! You have succeeded in installing ``sherpa`` on Windows.
