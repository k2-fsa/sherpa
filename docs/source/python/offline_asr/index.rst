Non-streaming speech recognition
================================

This part describes how to use `sherpa`_ for non-streaming (i.e., offline)
speech recognition.

Two types of models are supported:

  - `CTC`_
  - `transducer`_


We support standalone speech recognition as well as server/client based
speech recognition using `WebSocket`_.
