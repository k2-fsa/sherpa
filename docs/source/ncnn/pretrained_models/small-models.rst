Small models
============

In this section, we list models with fewer parameters that are suitable for
resource constrained embedded systems.

.. hint::

  If you are using Raspberry Pi 4, this section is not so helpful for you
  since all models in `sherpa-ncnn`_ are able to run in real-time on it.

  This page is especially useful for systems with less resource than
  Raspberry Pi 4.
