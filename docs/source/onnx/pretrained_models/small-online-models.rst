Small models
============

In this section, we list online/streaming models with fewer parameters
that are suitable for resource constrained embedded systems.

.. hint::

   You can use them as a first pass model in a two-pass system, where
   the second pass uses a non-streaming model.

.. hint::

  If you are using Raspberry Pi 4, this section is not so helpful for you
  since all models in `sherpa-onnx`_ are able to run in real-time on it.

  This page is especially useful for systems with less resource than
  Raspberry Pi 4.
