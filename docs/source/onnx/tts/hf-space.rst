Huggingface space
=================

We provide a huggingface space where you can try text-to-speech with
`sherpa-onnx`_ from within your browser without installing anything.

.. hint::

  We also have spaces using `WebAssembly`_ for text-to-speech. Please
  see :ref:`try sherpa onnx wasm with huggingface`.

All you need is a browser, either running on your desk computer, your phone, or
your iPad, etc.
