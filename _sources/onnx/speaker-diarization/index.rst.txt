Speaker Diarization
===================

This page describes how to use `sherpa-onnx`_ for speaker diarization.

Pre-trained models for speaker segmentation can be found
at `<https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/speaker-segmentation-models>`_

Pre-trained models for speaker embedding extraction can be found
at `<https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/releases/tag/speaker-recongition-models>`_

In the following, we describe different programming language APIs for speaker diarization.
