Build sherpa-ncnn for iOS
=========================

This section describes how to build `sherpa-ncnn`_ for ``iPhone`` and ``iPad``.

Requirement
-----------

.. warning::

  The minimum deployment requires the iOS version ``>= 13.0``.


Before we continue, please make sure the following requirements are satisfied:

- macOS. It won't work on Windows or Linux.
- Xcode. The version ``14.2 (14C18)`` is known to work. Other versions may also work.
- CMake. CMake 3.25.1 is known to work. Other versions may also work.
- (Optional) iPhone or iPad. This is for testing the app on your device.
  If you don't have a device, you can still run the app within a simulator on your Mac.

.. caution::

   If you get the following error::

      CMake Error at toolchains/ios.toolchain.cmake:544 (get_filename_component):
        get_filename_component called with incorrect number of arguments
      Call Stack (most recent call first):
        /usr/local/Cellar/cmake/3.29.0/share/cmake/Modules/CMakeDetermineSystem.cmake:146 (include)
        CMakeLists.txt:2 (project)

   please run::

     sudo xcode-select --install
     sudo xcodebuild -license

  And then delete the build directory ``./build-ios`` and re-build.

  Please see also `<https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx/issues/702>`_.

Download sherpa-ncnn
--------------------

First, let us download the source code of `sherpa-ncnn`_.

.. note::

  In the following, I will download `sherpa-ncnn`_ to
  ``$HOME/open-source``, i.e., ``/Users/fangjun/open-source``, on my Mac.

  You can put it anywhere as you like.

.. code-block:: bash

  mkdir -p $HOME/open-source
  cd $HOME/open-source
  git clone https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-ncnn

Build sherpa-ncnn (in commandline, C++ Part)
--------------------------------------------

After downloading `sherpa-ncnn`_, let us build the C++ part of `sherpa-ncnn`_.

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $HOME/open-source/sherpa-ncnn/
  ./build-ios.sh

It will generate a directory
``$HOME/open-source/sherpa-ncnn/build-ios``, which we have already pre-configured
for you in Xcode.

.. hint::

  You don't have to look at the generated files in ``$HOME/open-source/sherpa-ncnn/build-ios``
  to build an app. We have pre-configured it for you.

  If you are eager to learn more about the generated files or want to use
  `sherpa-ncnn`_ in your own iOS project, please have a look
  at :ref:`sherpa_ncnn_ios_swift_for_the_more_curious`.


Build sherpa-ncnn (in Xcode)
----------------------------

Use the following command to open `sherpa-ncnn`_ in Xcode:

.. code-block:: bash

  cd $HOME/open-source/sherpa-ncnn/ios-swift/SherpaNcnn
  open SherpaNcnn.xcodeproj

It will start Xcode and you will see the following screenshot:

  .. figure:: ./pic/start-xcode-for-sherpa-ncnn.png

     :width: 600
     :align: center

     Screenshot after running the command ``open SherpaNcnn.xcodeproj``

Please select ``Product -> Build`` to build the project. See the screenshot
below:

     :alt: Screenshot for selecting ``Product -> Build``
     :width: 600
     :align: center

     Screenshot for selecting ``Product -> Build``

After finishing the build, you should see the following screenshot:

  .. figure:: ./pic/after-finishing-build.png
     :alt: Screenshot after finishing the build.
     :width: 100
     :align: center

     Screenshot after finishing the build.

Congratulations! You have successfully built the project. Let us run the
project by selecting ``Product -> Run``, which is shown in the following
screenshot:

  .. figure:: ./pic/run-the-project.png
     :alt: Screenshot for ``Product -> Run``.
     :width: 600
     :align: center

     Screenshot for ``Product -> Run``.

Please wait for a few seconds before Xcode starts the simulator.

Unfortunately, it will throw the following error:

  .. figure:: ./pic/error-no-model.png
     :alt: Screenshot for the error
     :width: 600
     :align: center

     Screenshot for the error

The reason for the above error is that we have not provided the pre-trained
model yet.

The file `ViewController.swift <https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-ncnn/blob/master/ios-swift/SherpaNcnn/SherpaNcnn/ViewController.swift>`_
pre-selects the pre-trained model to be :ref:`sherpa-ncnn-mixed-english-chinese-conv-emformer-model`,
shown in the screenshot below:

  .. figure:: ./pic/pre-trained-model-1.png
     :alt: Screenshot for the pre-selected pre-trained model
     :width: 600
     :align: center

     Screenshot for the pre-selected pre-trained model

Let us add the pre-trained model :ref:`sherpa-ncnn-mixed-english-chinese-conv-emformer-model`
to Xcode. Please follow :ref:`sherpa-ncnn-mixed-english-chinese-conv-emformer-model`
to download it from `huggingface <https://huggingface.co/csukuangfj/sherpa-ncnn-conv-emformer-transducer-2022-12-06>`_.
You can download it to any directory as you like.

Please right click the project ``SherpaNcnn`` and select ``Add Files to "SherpaNcnn"...``
in the popup menu, as is shown in the screenshot below:

  .. figure:: ./pic/step-to-add-pre-trained-model-1.png
     :alt: Screenshot for adding files to SherpaNcnn
     :width: 600
     :align: center

In the popup dialog, switch to the folder where you just downloaded the pre-trained
model.

In the screenshot below, it is the
folder ``/Users/fangjun/open-source/icefall-models/sherpa-ncnn-conv-emformer-transducer-2022-12-06``:

  .. figure:: ./pic/step-to-add-pre-trained-model-2.png

Select required files and click the button ``Add``:

After adding pre-trained model files to Xcode, you should see the following
screenshot:

At this point, you should be able to select the menu ``Product -> Run``
to run the project and you should finally see the following screenshot:

  .. figure:: ./pic/run.png
     :alt: Screenshot for a successful run.
     :width: 600
